# Jacob's Super Minimal Blog

## Usage

Have Gridsome installed `npm install --global @gridsome/cli`.

Write posts using Markdown in `/content/posts`.

Run in dev mode with `npm run develop`, or build the static site with `npm run build`.

Copy to your favorite static web server! I am using Nginx pointed at an S3 bucket, with Traefik in front of it for HTTPS.
